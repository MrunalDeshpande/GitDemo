Tuple:
------------
A tuple is collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
In python tuple are written in()
Tuple is immutable.

If it is immutable below things are not possible:

1. We cannot modify existing value.
2. we cannot append new value.
3.we cannot insert new value
4.we cannot remove value.

Tuple is more secure than list.

By default tuple does not allow change values because it is 
immutable.But there is work around we can do this by indirect way
ie tuple->list(modify)->tuple

Copying tuple items is always possible because we cannot change 
data

You can delete complete tuple by using del command
ex: del mytuple

After deleting tuple you are trying to print tuple items then 
NameError: "Tuple name" is not defined

If you are trying to add items in the tuple below error shows:
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

Join/Combine tuple is always possible by using + operator
